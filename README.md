# jai-sdl3

Jai bindings for [SDL3 v3.2.14](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.14) using the Bindings Generator.

These bindings are 'pure', we don't add or change the interface to SDL3.

## Installation

Copy this into your modules folder, then:

- **Windows**: Put the proper (x64/arm64) `SDL3.dll` next to your executable. Prebuilt DLLs [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-3.2.14).
- **Linux**: Ensure SDL3 binaries are installed on your system (thanks to @marvhus).
- **MacOS**: Put the `arm64` dynamic library `libSDL3.dylib` (thanks to @4iwen).

SDL supports a ton of platforms, so adding support for things like Android/iOS/etc should be possible.

## Notes

Due to current limitations in the bindings generator, especially around nested macros, some enums (e.g. `SDL_WINDOW_...`) and macros (e.g. `SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED`) don't get generated by default.

To fix this we hardcode some code in `generate.jai` that gets put at the top of the generated bindings file. As the bindings generator matures we should be able to get incrementally get rid of these until the bindings are fully automated.

## Contribution

Want to support a new platform or found some missing enums/macros not generated? please feel free to send a PR!

To support a new platform check `generate.jai` and replicate what's done in the Windows/Linux section for your platform, then run `jai generate.jai`.
